Maven Quick Start project

mvn compile:
The goals for the Compiler Plugin are bound to their respective phases in the build lifecycle. So to compile your sources, you need only to tell maven until which lifecycle to execute. 

mvn install:

The install:install goal
In most cases, install:install goal doesn't need any configuration, it needs the project's POM and the artifact file to be installed during the install phase of the default build lifecycle.
The install:install-file goal

The install:install-file goal is used primarily for installing artifacts to the local repository which were not built by Maven. The project's development team may or may not provide a POM for the artifact. Here's a list of some of the available parameters for the install-file goal:

    mvn install:install-file -Dfile=your-artifact-1.0.jar \
                             [-DpomFile=your-pom.xml] \
                             [-Dsources=src.jar] \
                             [-Djavadoc=apidocs.jar] \
                             [-DgroupId=org.some.group] \
                             [-DartifactId=your-artifact] \
                             [-Dversion=1.0] \
                             [-Dpackaging=jar] \
                             [-Dclassifier=sources] \
                             [-DgeneratePom=true] \
                             [-DcreateChecksum=true]
                             
mvn clean:
The Maven Clean Plugin, as the name implies, attempts to clean the files and directories generated by Maven during its build. While there are plugins that generate additional files, the Clean Plugin assumes that these files are generated inside the target directory.
